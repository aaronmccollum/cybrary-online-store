# Cybrary Online Store Project

### About the Project
This is a mock online store page for Cybrary. The hope and goal of this project is to present a front-end design using HTML and CSS that accurately replicates the branding of Cybrary and the standards of a store, including current UI experiences, a payment form, and a personal product page for each item being sold.

### Skills practiced
- Semantic HTML
- Connecting multiple pages to make a website
- Matching UI experiences with a real website
